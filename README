Fraise 3.7.2

Author: Jean-Francois Moy

Here we are, the fruit is mature. Fraise 3.7.2 has just been released. This version should be bug-free but refactoring from Smultron could have brought some bugs that I haven't noticed yet so please report any bug you will encounter. I also wait for any remarks concerning Fraise and I hope I will have your support as with Smultron 3.7.1. Please spread the word around you concerning this new release!

Now it is time to taste Fraise; I hope you will like it.

Important message:

I have removed all translations that have not been updated because they don't contain references to the new update system and other new features. If you want to translate Fraise in your language, please contact me (a big part of the application is already translated in multiple languages so it won't require a lot of time).
